# Changelog

All notable changes to `purr` will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-27 (Project Tuki Universal Edition)

### ✨ Features
* **🐾 Official Rebrand to Purr**: The universal app discovery engine, dedicated to Tuki (2019–2024).
* **Universal Discovery Engine**: Searches System (Pacman / archlinuxcn), AUR, Flatpak (Flathub), and AppImage simultaneously.
* **Strict Priority Hierarchy**: System (1) $\rightarrow$ AUR (2) $\rightarrow$ Flatpak (3) $\rightarrow$ AppImage (4) $\rightarrow$ Git (5).
* **Heuristic Query Expansion**: Multi-term parsing, canonical slugs, and brand-to-package alias dictionary.
* **AUR Popularity Weighting**: Community vote scaling ($\log_{10}(\text{Votes})$) prevents obscure packages from outranking popular ones.
* **Auxiliary Noise Filter**: Automatically detects and suppresses plugins, extensions, drivers, and language servers.
* **Zero-Touch Unattended Installation**: Silent flag automation for `yay`, `pacman`, and `flatpak`.
* **Persistent Session Loop**: Window stays open after install, offering instant `[l]` launch or further searches.
* **Universal System Upgrade Engine (`purr upgrade`)**: Multi-tiered unattended upgrades with automated conflict resolution, stale database lock recovery, keyring auto-synchronization, `--ask 4` package replacement, and `--overwrite "*"` conflict bypassing.
* **Automated Flatpak Runtime Pruning**: Auto-detects and purges unsupported, unreferenced, and End-of-Life (EOL) SDKs and runtimes (`flatpak uninstall --unused -y`).
* **Native KDE Plasma 6 Desktop Integration**: Non-destructive Task Manager pin/unpin via in-memory DBus scripts, Kickoff favorites injection, and XDG Autostart.
* **Qt6 StatusNotifierItem Tray Indicator (`purr-tray`)**: Background update monitor with color-coded urgency halos, network outage backoff retry, and an interactive GUI check frequency dialog.
* **Instant IPC Indicator Refresh**: Dual-channel IPC (`QFileSystemWatcher` trigger + `SIGUSR1`) forces the tray indicator to immediately refresh after any CLI upgrade or package installation.
* **Complete UNIX Manual Pages**: Manpages for `purr.1`, `purr-tray.1`, `purr-integrate.1`, and `tuki.1`.
* **Shell Completions**: Comprehensive Bash & Zsh auto-completions for `purr` and `tuki`.
* **Complete Uninstaller (`uninstall.sh`)**: 9-step clean teardown of all binaries, integrations, desktop files, icons, completions, manpages, and config caches.
